### Introdution

The documentation is the weakest part of this repository. For now I'm just including a very brief description of the structure and contents of the project.

###Distribution and license
These repository uses GPL V2 (unless stated in a specific script or folder). In short terms it means you can use the contents freely. If you change them and distribute the results, you must also make the "code" available (with the current contents this is redundant as the script is the code)- The full license text can be read here:

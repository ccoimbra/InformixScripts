INTRODUCTION:
====================================================================================================

This is the first public release (0.9b) of ixlocks, an Open Admin Tool (OAT) plugin to monitor locks.
The software is distributed accordingly to the Apache license:

 http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

DISCLAIMER:
====================================================================================================

This software is provided AS IS, without any kind of guarantee. Use at your own risk.
Although the author is an IBM employee, this software was developed outside his job scope. As such
all responsability and credits is due to the author.


REQUIREMENTS:
====================================================================================================
This plugin requires OAT 2.27 or higher. It was tested mostly on 2.28.


INSTALL:
====================================================================================================

Just copy the ZIP file into the plugin_install subdirectory of your OAT installation.
For example, if you installed it in /usr/informix/oat, this would be something like:

/usr/informix/oat/Apache*/htdocs/openadmin/plugin_install

After that access your OAT administration page and choose "Plug-in Manager".
You should see the plugin listed in the "Plug-ins not installed yet".

Just click on INSTALL button and make sure it's marked as enabled


USAGE:
====================================================================================================

After installation you should have a new menu group (Lock Manager) just below the SQL Toolbox.
The group has four menu items:

- Lock list
	Shows information similar (but hopefully more complete and easier) to onstat -K
- Locks with waiters
	Shows locks which have sessions waiting on them
- Locks per table
	Shows the number of active locks, lock requests, lock timeouts and lock waitings for the
	active tables in your system
- Locks per session
	Shows the number of active locks, lock requests, lock timeouts and lock waitings for the
	existing sessions in your instance


Some fields like Session IDs are clickable and will take you into OAT standard session pages

This plugin includes the standard English localization as well as Portuguese. The Portuguese
messages are probably more addapted to European Portuguese while the Portuguese translation of OAT
is for Brazilian Portuguese.


TODO:
====================================================================================================

Some more tests need to be done. Some issues are already known:

- The lock list page is not doing any pagination. So if you have a large number of active locks in
your system this page can get HUGE. Be careful!

Some improvements are being considered:
- Implementing pagination where relevant
- Making more fields "clickable"
- Allow the DBA to kill sessions from the output of the plugins
- Allow the user to filter off the system databases
- More languages (It's impossible for me to do it, but if someone creates the messages, I'd be glad
to include it in a future version)


The author would really like to receive feedback and improvement suggestions.
News about the plugin (if any) will be posted in the author's blog at:
